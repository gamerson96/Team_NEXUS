## 🧠 Advanced Concepts

### Machine Learning Model
Our core prediction engine uses an ensemble of models:
- Random Forest for pattern recognition
- LSTM networks for time series forecasting
- Gradient Boosting for feature importance

### Data Fusion Algorithm
We employ a novel data fusion algorithm that combines:
- Satellite imagery
- Ground sensor data
- Historical disaster records
- Social media sentiment analysis

This multi-modal approach significantly improves prediction accuracy.

### Scalable Architecture
The application is built on a microservices architecture, allowing for:
- Easy scaling during peak disaster seasons
- Modular updates and improvements
- Regional customization without affecting the core system
